# GitHub Repository Cloning Tool

A versatile bash script tool that simplifies the process of cloning GitHub repositories based on user, organization, or starred repositories.

## Features

- Clone all repositories of a specific user.
- Clone all repositories of a specific organization.
- Clone all starred repositories of a specific user.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have `curl` and `jq` installed on your machine.
2. You should have `git` installed and configured with your GitHub credentials.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd path-to-repository
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x clone_github_repos.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./clone_github_repos.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and personal access token (needed for API requests).
2. Choose the desired option:
   - `1`: Clone repositories of a user.
   - `2`: Clone repositories of an organization.
   - `3`: Clone starred repositories of a user.

3. For the chosen option, follow the on-screen instructions.

## Directory Structure

- When cloning repositories of a user or organization, the repositories are saved in a structure: `cloned/(username-or-organization-name)/(repository-name)`
- When cloning starred repositories, the repositories are saved in a structure: `cloned/(name-of-real-owner)/(repository-name)`
